### Interfacing AI with simulation

The **DeepPhysX** project provides Python packages allowing users to easily interface their **numerical simulations**
with **learning algorithms**.

### Features

**DeepPhysX** is a full Python3 projects with the following main features:
* Generate a dataset with synthetic data from numerical simulations;
* Train an artificial neural network with a synthetic dataset;
* Use the predictions of a trained network in a numerical simulation.

The full list of features is detailed in the [**documentation**](https://deepphysx.readthedocs.io).
